# Ashutosh — One‑page Portfolio

A clean, responsive one‑page site for a PhD engineer. Edit `index.html` to personalize sections.

## Quick Start

1. Open `index.html` in your browser to preview locally.
2. Replace placeholders:
   - Profile links (GitHub/Scholar/LinkedIn)
   - Projects (cards in the `#projects` section)
   - Publications (list items in `#publications`)
   - Email in the Contact section
   - `assets/cv.pdf` with your real CV
3. Deploy (any of these):
   - **GitHub Pages**: push the folder to a repo → Settings → Pages → deploy from `main`.
   - **Netlify**: drag‑and‑drop the folder into the app.
   - **Firebase Hosting**: `firebase init` → `firebase deploy`.

## Theming
- Light/dark toggle is built‑in. Colors are in `assets/styles.css` as CSS variables.

## Structure
```
/ (index.html)
/assets/styles.css
/assets/script.js
/assets/avatar.svg
/assets/cv.pdf (placeholder)
```
